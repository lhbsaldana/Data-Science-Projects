### Decision Tree
- Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. 
- for regression: The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. 
- for classification: The goal is to predict the class/group of the target variable
