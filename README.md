### Equivalence Class Clustering and Bottom-up Lattice Traversal Algorithm (ECLAT)
- ECLAT is one of the <strong><em> Association Rule Mining Algorithms</strong></em>
- implemented with Python

### Association Rule Mining (ARM) 
- also known as Market Basket Analysis
- helps discover relationships between independent relational databases
- ARM is primarily used in retail (recommendation system)
- To simplify, the logic behind the association rule mining is if two/more items are frequently bought together, these items can be recommended to the customer when he buys one of these items

### ECLAT 
Pros: 
*   faster than Apriori Algorithm 
*   uses depth-first search approach to discover association rules 
*   consumes less memory 

Cons: 
*   only uses support as its metrics for evaluating strength of association rule
