## Welcome! 

<p> This repository contains projects related to Data Analysis. </p> 

[Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/lhbsaldana/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Fake_News_Classification.ipynb)
  <ul> 
  <li> This project aims to answer the question: “How to detect fake news?” using ML techniques such as Multinomial Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Passive-Aggressive Classifiers. 
</li>
  </ul>


[Decision Tree Regressor](https://github.com/lhbsaldana/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Decision%20Tree%20Regressor.ipynb) 
 <ul> 
  <li> This project aims to predict the temperature using the salinity of the ocean. The model is trained using the CALCOFI dataset, which incorporates oceanographic data in the California Current from 1949 till the present. </li>
  </ul>

[PH Poverty Case Study (Time Series Analysis)](https://github.com/lhbsaldana/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/PH%20Poverty%20Case%20Study%20(Time%20Series%20Analysis).ipynb) 
 <ul> 
  <li> This project aims to answer three questions, namely: 
    <ul> 
<li> Was there a significant change in the magnitude of the poor population between 2006,2009,2012, and 2015?</li>
<li> Was there a significant change in the magnitude of the subsistence poor population between 2006,2009,2012, and 2015? </li>
<li> Is there a correlation between the magnitude of the poor population and the magnitude of the subsistence poor population? </li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>

 [Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/lhbsaldana/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Market_Basket%20%20Analysis%20.ipynb)
 <ul> 
  <li> This project aims to analyze purchase order data and identify which products can be recommended to the customer when he buys one of the items from the store. The project employed an equivalence Class Clustering and Bottom-up Lattice Traversal Algorithm (ECLAT) since this is faster than the widely used Apriori algorithm. </li>
  </ul>

  [Sales Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/lhbsaldana/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Sales%20Dashboard.pdf) 
   <ul> 
  <li> This project aims to create a sales overview to monitor and measure sales performance in key areas such as total net sales, sales made by employees, and sales by product. The dashboard uses different visualization tools such as pie chart, line graph, bar chart, and matrix. </li>
   </ul>

   [Airbnb Project](https://github.com/lhbsaldana/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Airbnb%20Project)
   <ul>
<li>
  This project aims to: 
      <ul> 
<li> Identify metrics that can track the success of the team's effort in improving the guest-host matching process? </li>
<li> Identy areas the company need to invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro </li>
<li> Determine other approaches to get more clarity on the matching of supply and demand, beyond the data provided </li>
    </ul>
</li> 
   </ul>
